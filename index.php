                The Turkish Riviera, also known as the Turquoise Coast, 
                stretches for 600 miles from Alanaya in the East, along the 
                country's North-West shores to Cesme. Much of the coastline is 
                dramatic and beautiful... But the jewel in this Riviera's 
                crown is the fat fist of the Bodrum peninsular &mdash; and it is here 
                that you will find Turkey's own version of St. Tropez.
